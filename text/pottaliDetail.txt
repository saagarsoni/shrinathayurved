Potli massage is a popular massage therapy which has been carried out from the ancient ages. It affects our body, emotions, mind, and spirit. It helps simulates & releases tension in shoulders, neck, and back. A potli massage helps brings the body and mind into harmony. Potli massages work on an age-old philosophy which is based on the confluence of the elements of fire and water combined with specific herbs. When the heated potli is massaged on the body, it opens the pores and relaxes the muscles, allowing the carefully selected herbs to work on the body and mind.
