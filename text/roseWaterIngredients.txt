Rose water is made from steam distillation of rose petals, typically from the Damask rose (Rosa damascena). The main ingredient in rose water is water, and the only other ingredient is rose oil, which is a byproduct of the distillation process. The rose oil is what gives rose water its distinctive fragrance and therapeutic properties.
